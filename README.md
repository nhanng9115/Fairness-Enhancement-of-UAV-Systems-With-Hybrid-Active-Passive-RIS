To run the code successfully, please make sure that you properly installed YALMIP and MOSEK with the right license. Before running the main files, edit the file add_solver.m to link the solver folders (YALMIP and MOSEK) to the code folder.

I already uploaded one channel sample for running test. If you want to modify, improve, and obtain the results for your own research, you can generate more channels using the finle gen_channel.m.

Please kindly cite the above papers if the code is helpful for your research.
